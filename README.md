lunchbeat - 1bit groovebox
=======================

Hi.
This is original breadboard Lunchbeat repository.
If you want build Lunchbeat on breadboard, use this.

I do not intend to update or upgrade this version.
It is to stay as simple as it is.

Otherwise, I am doing firmware upgrades for PCB version of Lunchbeat.  
In LUNCHBEAT-PCB repository is now firmware version 1.2 with advanced synchronization. Check it out.

If you want to build or you already have PCB version, please use "lunchbeat-PCB" repository.

I hope this makes sense to you :)

The firmware is released under a GPL3.0 license.
The PCB layout and schematics are released under cc-by-sa 3.0 license.
